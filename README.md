## Introduction

The **Crop Recommendation System** uses machine learning to recommend suitable crops for specific environmental conditions. It helps farmers make data-driven decisions by analyzing factors such as soil type, temperature, and humidity.

The system is built with **Flask** for the web interface and **scikit-learn** to create and train the recommendation model.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Model**: The model predicts the best crop based on temperature, humidity, and soil type.
- **Web Interface**: Built with Flask, allowing users to input data and receive crop recommendations.
- **Data-Driven**: Uses real agricultural data for accurate predictions.
- **Scalable**: Easily extendable to include more features or data.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** - Core programming language
- **Flask** - Web framework for building the user interface
- **scikit-learn** - Machine learning library for model creation and predictions
- **pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **numpy** - Numerical computations
- **HTML/CSS** - Frontend design for the web interface

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have Python 3.6+ installed. You’ll need the following dependencies:

- **Flask** for creating the web app
- **scikit-learn** for machine learning model
- **pandas** for data handling
- **numpy** for numerical calculations

### Clone the Repository
